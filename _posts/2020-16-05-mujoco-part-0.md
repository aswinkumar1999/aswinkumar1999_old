Hi ! Welcome to my Blog on MuJoCo. The Aim of this blog is to get people on-board MuJoCo in the least time possible. I am a Sophomore at a University, my Programming experience has been developed by looking at multiple example and reading code, but when it came to MuJoCo, the Documentation was very thorough yet i felt like i was lacking the basic skills to understand a lot of them initially and was very intimitated when i first came across it. So I set myself a goal to write MuJoCo blogs which would help people who love explanations through examples. **But do remember , the blog is supposed to set a starting point and break the ice for people who do not have any major first hand experiences in robotic modelling , i refer the XML Reference all the time and once you get familiar and comfortable with the basic , do use the documentation to make sure you are exploiting all the features of MuJoCo.**

In this post , Let us cover the Following : 

- What is MuJoCo ? 
- How a Model is defined in MuJoCo ? 
- Intro to MuJoCo-Py 
- MuJoCo-Py Installtion 
- Hello World in MuJoCo !

# What is MuJoCo ? 

MuJoCo stands for **Mu**lti-**Jo**int dynamics with **Co**ntact.
