Hi ! Welcome to my Blog on MuJoCo. The Aim of this blog is to get people on-board MuJoCo in the least time possible. I am a Sophomore at a University, my Programming experience has been developed by looking at multiple example and reading code, but when it came to MuJoCo, the Documentation was very thorough yet i felt like i was lacking the basic skills to understand a lot of them initially and was very intimitated when i first came across it. So I set myself a goal to write MuJoCo blogs which would help people who love explanations through examples. **But do remember , the blog is supposed to set a starting point and break the ice for people who do not have any major first hand experiences in robotic modelling , i refer the XML Reference all the time and once you get familiar and comfortable with the basic , do use the documentation to make sure you are exploiting all the features of MuJoCo.**

In this post , Let us cover the Following :

- What is MuJoCo ?
- How a Model is defined in MuJoCo ?
- Intro to mujoco-py
- mujoco-py Installtion
- Hello World in MuJoCo !

# What is MuJoCo ?

MuJoCo stands for **Mu**lti-**Jo**int dynamics with **Co**ntact.

MuJoCo is a physics engine aiming to facilitate research and development in robotics, biomechanics, graphics and animation, and other areas where fast and accurate simulation is needed. It offers a unique combination of speed, accuracy and modeling power, yet it is not merely a better simulator.

### Licenses

You can head over to [MuJoCo License page](https://www.roboti.us/license.html) and obtain a license to use their software. If you are a student , then you get 1 year if MuJoCo for free.


# How is a Model defined in MuJoCo ?

The user specifies models in the native MJCF format - which is an XML file format designed to be as human readable and editable as possible. URDF model files can also be loaded.

Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) is a popular XML file format in which many robots have been modeled.

In this blog , we will discuss more about MJCF and not discuss about URDF format.

# mujoco-py

#### [Documentation for mujoco-py](https://openai.github.io/mujoco-py/build/html/index.html)
#### [GitHub](https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py)

`mujoco-py` is a library which allows using MuJoCo from Python3.

This is particularly very useful when we design Control Systems or AI agents for robots. mujoco-py was developed by [OpenAI](https://openai.com).

You can install `mujoco-py` by using pip

```
$ pip3 install -U 'mujoco-py<2.1,>=2.0'
```

### Install from source

Clone this repository and move into the directory.
```
git clone git@github.com:openai/mujoco-py.git
cd mujoco-py
```
Make sure your setup tools are up to date
```
python -m pip install --upgrade setuptools
```
Install both regular and dev dependencies for mujoco-py
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.dev.txt
```
Now install mujoco-py
```
python setup.py install
```

#### Post-Installation Steps

- Download the MuJoCo version 2.0 binaries for Linux or OSX.

- Unzip the downloaded mujoco200 directory into `~/.mujoco/mujoco200`, and place your license key (the `mjkey.txt` file from your email) at `~/.mujoco/mjkey.txt`.


If everything completes successfully you should be able to run the examples

```bash
python examples\body_interaction.py
```

## Hello World in MuJoCo

Great , with all the above steps performed, let's go on build our first model.

Now , Let's verify we are in the correct directory.

```bash
$ cd ~/.mujoco/mujoco200/  
$ pwd
/Users/~user~/.mujoco/mujoco200
```

Let us now create a new folder where we will save our models and python files.

```bash
$ mkdir my_files
```

Create a new model file in this folder and add a few lines to it.

```bash
$ touch my_files/hello_mujoco.xml
```

Add the following lines to it and save it.

```xml
<mujoco>
   <worldbody>
      <light diffuse=".5 .5 .5" pos="0 0 3" dir="0 0 -1"/>    
      <geom type="plane" size="1 1 0.1" rgba=".9 0 0 1"/>
      <body pos="0 0 1">
         <joint type="free"/>
         <geom type="box" size=".1 .2 .3" rgba="0 .9 0 1"/>
      </body>
   </worldbody>
</mujoco>
```

Let us now simulate this and then go back to seeing them in detail line-by-line.

To simulate this do the following :

``` bash
$ cd /bin # Change to directory containing the binaries
$ ./simnulate ../my_files/hello_mujoco.xml
```

Voila !! Now you have an OpenGL window pop-up with the animation of the falling cube.

</p>


Now Let us see in brief about what the lines mean , for which we will extensively use the [documentation](http://www.mujoco.org/book/XMLreference.html) provided by MuJoCo

#### `<mujoco>` Tag

Every MJCF files starts with `<mujoco>` tag and ends with `</mujoco>` , Why should it start and end this way you may ask , given we are using mujoco , isn't all of it be MuJoCo code ? why does the compiler require us to specific it ?

Because this helps us identify between URDF and MJCF files, Also we can use MuJoCo for [some parts for URDF file](http://www.mujoco.org/book/modeling.html#CURDF).


#### `<worldbody>` Tag

The element worldbody is used for the top-level body, while the element body is used for all other bodies. We define the worldbody tag to describe our model.

[Reference](http://www.mujoco.org/book/XMLreference.html#body)


#### `<light>`

Here we describe a fix light source in the world body , you can also create light which moves with the body , when the `<light>` tag is nested inside the body

- Diffuse ( r g b ) : Here we define how the reflection of light to all directions at a point, Other Paramteres Include : Ambient and Specular .... Check this out [What is the difference between Ambient, Diffuse, and Specular Light in OpenGL?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-Ambient-Diffuse-and-Specular-Light-in-OpenGL-Figures-for-illustration-are-encouraged#)

- pos ( x y z )  : Defines the X , Y , Z coordinate of the light source

- dir ( x y z ) : Defines the direction of the light

#### `<geom>`

Here we describe of the geometry of the body , and in this specific case , we describe a plane with length and breath of 1 unity and a thickness of 0.1 , If you see the Documentation, you see `<geom>` nested under `<body>` , and in this case , the plane we described is a part of the world body.

- size ( x y z ) : x , y , z sizes of the body.

- rgba ( r g b a ) : Color of the geometry - Red , Blue , Green and Alpha Channel values from 0 to 1

Bonus : Recording function & Converting to GIF

#### `<body>`

Here we describe a child body under the parent of worldbody , here we use `pos` to define the position of the body frame.

There are other parameters which are listed in the Documentation.

#### `<joint>`

We use `<joint>` to describe to the motion degress of freedom between the defined body and it's parents , in this case the worldbody.

- type : [free, ball, slide, hinge], "hinge" - Uses Hinge when type is not specified.
        - free joint allow 3 axis of translation and 3 axis of rotation.

With this we can conclude the first blog post on MuJoCo.

### Bonus

I use the record function to record the videos such as the GIF above.

The record function is also part of the `bin` folder

```bash
$ ./record ../my_files/hello_mujoco.xml 5 60 rgb.out
$ ffmpeg -f rawvideo -pixel_format rgb24 -video_size 640x480 -framerate 60 -i rgb.out -vf "vflip" video.mp4
```

This would give the output as `video.mp4`

I used this script for this blog to create GIFs easily

```bash
#!/bin/sh

palette="/tmp/palette.png"

filters="fps=10,scale=480:-1:flags=lanczos"

./record "$1" 5 60 rgb.out

ffmpeg -f rawvideo -pixel_format rgb24 -video_size 640x480 -framerate 60 -i rgb.out -vf "vflip" video.mp4

ffmpeg -v warning -i video.mp4 -vf "$filters,palettegen" -y "$palette"
ffmpeg -v warning -i video.mp4 -i $palette -lavfi "$filters [x]; [x][1:v] paletteuse" -y "$2"

rm rgb.out video.mp4
```

Save it as gif_script.sh and `chmod +x gif_script.sh`

To run it :

```
$ ./gif_script.sh ../my_files/hello_mujoco.xml ../my_files/hello_mujoco.gif
```

Thank you for taking your time to go through this. All the files used in this are uploaded in this Github Folder , You can go through them and create issues incase i've made a mistake or leave your feedback there.
